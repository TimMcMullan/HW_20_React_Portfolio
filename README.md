## Description :
Homework Challenge #20 - to build a portfolio using React !!  Challenging to say the least, and abandoned, as usual, due to deadlines, this was fun to create and posesses so much potential in the little things I'll do soon that I almost want to keep going.  Alas, physical fatigue and mental exhaustion have pushed us past, WELL past, a point of diminishing returns.

## Technologies :
A vast amount, unfathomable by the ordinary human, was used to create this single-page (but actually like 4 pages, and arguably more) event.  From mundane technologies such as CSS and HTML, to cutting edge web-design applied by React, to some nice finishing touches provided by AOS and even Adobe.
